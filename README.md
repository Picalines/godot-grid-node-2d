# godot-grid-node-2d

This plugin adds a custom `GridNode2D` node for Godot 3.x and C# 9+.

It's basicly a boilerplate that I've been using in top-down view grid based games.

See [GridNode2D.cs](addons/grid-node-2d/GridNode2D.cs) for method docs. [GridDirection2D.cs](addons/grid-node-2d/GridDirection2D.cs) contains useful extension methods.
